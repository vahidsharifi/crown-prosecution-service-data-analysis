Note 1:
This code contains some visualisations which need internet to be run, so ensure that you are online.
Some of them, such as the online area maps using Google maps, might not properly work with the first attempt.
There are some notes for those parts that might not run with the first attempt during execution. Please follow those instructions.



Note 2:
This code is developed on MacOS. Therefore, the import method is just working for MacOS. 
To run this code on Windows, you need to change all forward slashes to back slashes in import code.



Note 3:
Considering the assignment criteria, there need to be at least two hypotheses.
Some of the visualisations contain these hypothesises in their analysis section. Also, in some parts, the hypothesis is directly mentioned. 



Note 4:
This code contains a Dynamic Animated Graph. However, as the report is in PDF format, this graph is static. Therefore, a copy of this plot is put in the files. The name of this file is "animation.gif".
Also, if you open "R Project.ipynb" file, you can see this dynamic representation.
