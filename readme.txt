Note 1:
This code contains some visualizations which need internet to be run, so ensure that you are online.
Some of them such as online area maps of google might not properly work with first attempt.
There are some note for those parts might not run wth first attempt during execution. Please follow those instructions.



Note 2:
This code is developed on MacOS. Therefore, the import method is just working for MacOS. 
To run this code on windows, you need to change all forward slashes to back slashes in import code.



Note 3:
Considering the assignments criteria, there need to be at least two hypothesis.
Some of visualizations contains these hypothesises in their analysis section. Also in some parts, the hypothesis is directly mentioned. 



Note 4:
This code contains a Dynamic Animated Graph. However, as the report is in PDF format, this graph is static. Therefore, a copy of this plot is put in the files. The name of this file is animation.gif.
Also, if you open R Project.ipynb file, you can see this dynamic representation.
